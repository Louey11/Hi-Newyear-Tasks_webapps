# Hi-Newyear-Tasks_webapps
these are basic web application projects using the open-source python based web framework : Django.
i've created these simple web apps to initiate myself in the world of web apps that i find interesting and i chose to start with django the framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern that i find particulary simpler and more efficient than other concurrent frameworks.
## setup 
download the folder
then on your unix based terminal :
- 'cd (directory)' to directory of the folder
- 'python manage.py runserver' 
and then copy and paste the URL which is usually 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/(insert app name)' to your browser and voila
## exploration 
the code in relation to the content of the web apps is made in such way to make it easy to understand once browsed and looked at, that's why i provided little to no comments in the code.
## Contribution
Feel free to contribute and play around with the code to fit your own taste
