# Hi-Newyear-Tasks_webapps
these are basic web application projects using the open-source python based web framework : Django.
i've created these simple web apps to initiate myself in the world of web apps that i find interesting and i chose to start with django the open-source, Python-based web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern that i find particulary simpler than other concurrent frameworks.
